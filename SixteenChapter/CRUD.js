// n the context of computer programming and databases, "CRUD" stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four fundamental operations that allow users to manage data in a database or application. A CRUD application provides the ability to create new records, view existing ones, modify them, and remove them. 
// Here's a more detailed breakdown:
// Create: Adding new data to the database or application.
// Read: Retrieving existing data for viewing or analysis.
// Update: Modifying or changing existing data.
// Delete: Removing data from the database or application. 
// CRUD operations are the foundation of many web applications and database systems. They enable users to interact with data stored in a database through a user interface or API. Examples of CRUD operations in different contexts: 
// Databases:
// Creating a new user profile, reading a user's information, updating a user's contact details, and deleting a user account. 
// Web Applications:
// Creating a new blog post, reading existing blog posts, updating a blog post, and deleting a blog post. 
// RESTful APIs:
// // Using HTTP methods like POST (Create), GET (Read), PUT/PATCH (Update), and DELETE to interact with a data store.
