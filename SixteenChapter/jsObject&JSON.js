// Different Between JavaScript Object and JSON

// 1. js object is a data structure that can hold various data types, including functions, while JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a string representation of an object that is used for data interchange.
// 2. JavaScript objects can contain methods and properties, while JSON is purely a data format that only contains data in key-value pairs.
// 3. JavaScript objects can be created using object literals, constructors, or classes, while JSON is typically created as a string that follows a specific syntax.
// 4. JavaScript objects can be manipulated directly in code, while JSON must be parsed into a JavaScript object using `JSON.parse()` before it can be used.
// 5. JavaScript objects can include functions, whereas JSON cannot include functions or any executable code.
// // 6. JavaScript objects can have properties with different data types, including functions, while JSON only supports string, number, boolean, null, array, and object data types.
// // 7. JavaScript objects can be modified and updated dynamically, while JSON is immutable once it is created as a string.
