// what is eval in js and why use it?

// The eval() function in JavaScript takes a string as an argument and executes it as JavaScript code. It is used to evaluate code dynamically at runtime. While it can be useful in certain situations, it's generally advised to avoid using eval() due to security risks and performance concerns. 
// eval() can be used for: 
// Dynamic code execution: Generating and executing code based on user input or other dynamic factors.
// Testing and debugging: Quickly testing and debugging code snippets.
// Custom expressions: Evaluating custom expressions that may not be possible with regular JavaScript code.




// what is with in js and why use it?
// In JavaScript, the with statement establishes a scope chain for the statements within its block, using a specified object as the head of that chain. This means that inside the with block, properties of the object can be accessed directly as if they were variables in the current scope.

// While with can shorten code and make it more readable in some cases, it is generally discouraged due to potential ambiguity and performance issues. It can make it difficult to determine the scope of variables, especially when the same property name exists in multiple scopes. Additionally, it can hinder optimization by JavaScript engines.
// For these reasons, modern JavaScript development typically avoids the use of with in favor of more explicit and predictable alternatives, such as destructuring or direct property access.
